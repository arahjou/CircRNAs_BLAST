# CircRNAs_BLAST

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a unique type of non-coding RNA that differs from linear RNAs as they form a covalently closed loop without 5' caps or 3' poly(A) tails. These molecules are generated by back-splicing, where the 3' end of an exon is joined to the 5' end of a previous exon to produce a continuous circular structure. Research has demonstrated that after viral infection of cells, the expression of circRNAs can change dramatically. These molecules have the ability to indirectly regulate virus replication by triggering the immune system response.

One of the ways circRNAs regulate cellular processes is by acting as sponges for miRNAs. This suggests that circRNAs could potentially play a role in protecting against viral genetic material. Therefore, performing a circRNA BLAST against all known virus genomes could provide valuable insights for further evaluation or evolutionary studies.

As a result, I have developed a code for high-throughput BLAST analysis of all known circRNAs against all known viruses from same species (here mouse) and visualizing the results.
